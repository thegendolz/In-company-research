# Using Alpha Trees for traffic sign recognition

Install OpenCV2: https://opencv.org/

Put all library files within visual studio as external libraries in order to use. To use a different image place it in the root folder and change the text in filereader.cpp

IMPORTANT

Since this program uses a recursive function it might be good to increase the stack size within visual studio.
